# Epic Games Clone

Shopping Cart assignment from "The Odin Project"

## Background

This project is an assignment from [The Odin Project ⚡](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart').


The purpose of this project is to learn React Router and deepen our understanding of React in general.


Initially, I aimed to create a simple game store, drawing inspiration from the [Epic Games UI](https://store.epicgames.com/). However, as I progressed, I ended up building an Epic Games Clone 😁.
